Imagine that you work for a company that develops mobile games. A manager has come to you with a series of tasks to investigate various aspects of a mobile application:

First and foremost, they are interested in the retention rate. Write a function to calculate it.

Additionally, the company has conducted A/B testing of different sets of promotional offers. Based on the available data, determine which set can be considered the best and what metrics should be used to make the right decision.

Propose metrics to evaluate the results of the latest themed event in the game.

Task 1:
Retention is one of the most crucial metrics in the company. Your task is to write a function that calculates player retention (by days since the player's registration date).

The function should be written in Python. During the solution, you can test the function's performance on both the complete dataset and a sample of data.

Task 2:
You have results from an A/B test in which two groups of users were offered different sets of promotional offers. It is known that the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) in the test group is 5% higher than in the control group. Furthermore, in the control group, 1928 out of 202103 players became paying users, while in the test group, 1805 out of 202667 did.

Which set of offers can be considered the best? What metrics should be analyzed to make the right decision and how?

Task 3:
In the game "Plants & Gardens," thematic events are held every month, with limited time frames. During these events, players can obtain unique garden items, characters, additional coins, or bonuses. To receive rewards, players need to complete a series of levels within a specified time.

What metrics can be used to evaluate the results of the most recent event?

Suppose in another event, we made the event mechanics more challenging so that with each unsuccessful attempt to complete a level, a player would regress several levels backward. Would this change the set of metrics used to evaluate the results? If so, how?
